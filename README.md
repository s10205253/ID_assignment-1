# ID_assignment-1
For this assignment i made a website for the game company called riot games. The websites purpose is to let people know more about Riot Games and what is their latest works, as well as to promote their games to people who are intrested in playing them. The website will also be a place where people can buy official Riot Games Merchandise like t-shirts and posters.

# Design process
This website is mainly designed for people who are new to games made by Riot and want to learn more about them and their games. My website achieves this by offering concise and easy to understand information about Riot and its games and it also has multiple videos to help them learn and understand more.
